Shock is a platform to support computation, storage, and distribution. Designed from the ground up to be fast, scalable and fault tolerant.

Shock is a RESTful data management system. Accessible from desktops, HPC systems, exotic hardware, the cloud and your smartphone.

Shock is for scientific data. One of the challenges of large volume scientific data is that without often complex metadata it is of little to no value. Shock allows storage and querying of complex metadata.

Most importantly Shock is still very much in development. Be patient and contribute.

Shock is actively being developed at [GitHub](http://github.com/MG-RAST/Shock).
