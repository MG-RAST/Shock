About:
------

Shock is a platform to support computation, storage, and distribution. Designed from the ground up to be fast, scalable, fault tolerant, federated. 

Shock is RESTful. Accessible from desktops, HPC systems, exotic hardware, the cloud and your smartphone.

Shock is for scientific data. One of the challenges of large volume scientific data is that without often complex metadata it is of little to no value. Store and query(in development) complex metadata.   

Shock is an data management system. Annotate, anonymize, convert, filter, quality control, statically subsample at line speed bioinformatics sequence data. Extensible plug-in architecture(in development).

**Most importantly Shock is still very much in development. Be patient and contribute.**


Shock is actively being developed at [github.com/MG-RAST/Shock](http://github.com/MG-RAST/Shock).

<br>
### User:

- uuid: unique identifier
- name: username
- passwd: all responds are masked "**********" 
- admin: boolean

##### user example:

    { 
        "D": {
            "uuid": "67394386a4acac62fdb851d78691ee48"
            "name": "joeuser", 
            "passwd": "**********", 
            "admin": false, 
        }, 
        "E": null, 
        "S": 200
    }

<br>
### Index:

Currently there is support for two types of indices: virtual and file. 

##### virtual index:

A virtual index is one that can be generated on the fly without support of precalculated data. The current working example of this 
is the size virtual index. Based on the file size and desired chunksize the partitions become individually addressable. 

##### file index:

Currently in early development the file index is a json file stored on disk in the node's directory.

    # abstract form
    {
    	index_type : <type>,
    	filename : <filename>,
    	checksum_type : <type>,
    	version : <version>,
    	index : [
    		[<position>,<length>,<optional_checksum>]...
    	]
    }
    
    # example
    {
    	"index_type" : "fasta",
    	"filename" : "none",
    	"checksum_type" : "none",
    	"version" : 1,
    	"index" : [[0,1861]]
    }

API
---

### Response wrapper:
All responses from Shock currently are in the following encoding. 

    {
        "D": <data in json or null>,
        "E": <error message or null>, 
        "S": <http status of request>
    }

<a name="get_slash"/>
<br>
### GET /

Description of resources available through this api

##### example
	
    curl -X GET http://<host>[:<port>]/
	
##### returns

    {"resources":["node", "user"],"url":"http://localhost:8000/","documentation":"http://localhost/","contact":"admin@host.com","id":"Shock","type":"Shock"}

<a name="post_node"/>
<br>
### POST /node

Create node

 - optionally takes user/password via Basic Auth. If set only that user with have access to the node
 - accepts multipart/form-data encoded 
 - to set attributes include file field named "attributes" containing a json file of attributes
 - to set file include file field named "upload" containing any file **or** include field named "path" containing the file system path to the file accessible from the Shock server

##### example
	
	curl -X POST [ --user user:password ] [ -F "attributes=@<path_to_json>" ( -F "upload=@<path_to_data_file>" || -F "path=<path_to_file>") ] http://<host>[:<port>]/node
	
##### returns

    {
        "D": {<node>},
        "E": <error message or null>, 
        "S": <http status of response (also set in headers)>
    } 

<a name="get_nodes"/>
<br>
### GET /node

List nodes

 - optionally takes user/password via Basic Auth. Grants access to non-public data
 - by adding ?skip=N you get the nodes starting at N+1 
 - by adding ?limit=N you get a maximum of N nodes returned 

##### querying
All attributes are queriable. For example if a node has in it's attributes "about" : "metagenome" the url 

    /node/?query&about=metagenome
    
would return it and all other nodes with that attribute. Address of nested attributes like "metadata": { "env_biome": "ENVO:human-associated habitat", ... } is done via a dot notation 

    /node/?query&metadata.env_biome=ENVO:human-associated%20habitat

Multiple attributes can be selected in a single query and are treated as AND operations

    /node/?query&metadata.env_biome=ENVO:human-associated%20habitat&about=metagenome
    
**Note:** all special characters like a space must be url encoded.

##### example
	
	curl -X GET [ --user user:password ] http://<host>[:<port>]/node/[?skip=<skip>&limit=<count>][&query&<tag>=<value>]
		
##### returns

  	{
        "D": {[<array of nodes>]},
        "E": <error message or null>, 
        "S": <http status of request>
    }

<a name="get_node"/>
<br>
### GET /node/{id}

View node, download file (full or partial)

 - optionally takes user/password via Basic Auth
 - ?download - complete file download
 - ?download&index=size&part=1\[&part=2...\]\[chunksize=inbytes\] - download portion of the file via the size virtual index. Chunksize defaults to 1MB (1048576 bytes).

##### example	

	curl -X GET [ --user user:password ] http://<host>[:<port>]/node/{id}

##### returns

    {
        "D": {<node>},
        "E": <error message or null>, 
        "S": <http status of request>
    }

<a name="put_node"/>
<br>
### PUT /node/{id}

Modify node, create index

 - optionally takes user/password via Basic Auth
 
**Modify:** 

 - **Once the file or attributes of a node are set they are immutiable.**
 - accepts multipart/form-data encoded 
 - to set attributes include file field named "attributes" containing a json file of attributes
 - to set file include file field named "upload" containing any file **or** include field named "path" containing the file system path to the file accessible from the Shock server
   
##### example	
  
	curl -X PUT [ --user user:password ] [ -F "attributes=@<path_to_json>" ( -F "upload=@<path_to_data_file>" || -F "path=<path_to_file>") ] http://<host>[:<port>]/node/{id}

  
##### returns

    {
        "D": {<node>},
        "E": <error message or null>, 
        "S": <http status of request>
    }

<br>
**Create index:**

 - currently available index types: size, record (for sequence file types)

##### example	

	curl -X PUT [ --user user:password ] http://<host>[:<port>]/node/{id}?index=<type>

##### returns

    {
        "D": null,
        "E": <error message or null>, 
        "S": <http status of request>
    }

<a name="post_user"/>
<br>
### POST /user

Create user

Requires Basic Auth encoded as 'username:password'. To create an admin user 'username:password:secret-key:true' where secret-key was specified at server start.
	
##### example	

    # regular user (when config Anonymous:create-user=true)
    curl -X POST --user joeuser:1234 http://<host>[:<port>]/user

    # regular user (when config Anonymous:create-user=false)
    curl -X POST --user joeuser:1234:supersupersecret:false http://<host>[:<port>]/user    

    # admin user
    curl -X POST --user joeuser:1234:supersupersecret:true http://<host>[:<port>]/user
	
##### returns

    {
        "D": {<user>},
        "E": <error message or null>, 
        "S": <http status of request>
