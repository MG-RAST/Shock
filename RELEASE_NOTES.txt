# v0.9.2

Modified node ACL's to explicitly include a "public" string in the ACL if
that ACL is public. The previous behavior was to consider an ACL "public"
if that ACL was empty. This was restrictive in terms of managing ACL's.
Also, the "Public" field was removed from the node document because this
information will be solely managed by the ACL's.

To remove the "Public" field from all nodes in an existing Shock database,
the following mongo commands should be executed:
> use ShockDB
> db.Nodes.update(
  {},
  { $unset: {'public':1} },
  { multi: true }
)

The permissions for specific Shock actions are listed below:

#####POST

  - /node/&lt;node_id&gt;/acl  view node acls
  - /node/&lt;node_id&gt;/acl/&lt;type&gt;  view node acls of type &lt;type&gt;

#####PUT

  - /node/&lt;node_id&gt;/acl/&lt;type&gt;  modify node acls of type &lt;type&gt;

#####DELETE

* Permitted by: admin, node owner, users in delete ACL, or everyone if node is publicly deletable

  - /node/&lt;node_id&gt;/acl/&lt;type&gt;?users=<user-ids_or_uuids> delete users from ACL


NOTE: Although a node may be designated as publicly readable, writable, or deletable, user authentication may still be required depending on the Shock server's configuration.
