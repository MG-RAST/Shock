# v0.9.1

Modified node ACL's to explicitly include a "public" string in the ACL if
that ACL is public. The previous behavior was to consider an ACL "public"
if that ACL was empty. This was restrictive in terms of managing ACL's.
Also, the "Public" field was removed from the node document because this
information will be solely managed by the ACL's.

To remove the "Public" field from all nodes in an existing Shock database,
the following mongo commands should be executed:
> use ShockDB
> db.Nodes.update(
  {},
  { $unset: {'public':1} },
  { multi: true }
)
